# 5. Print the answer

# Import modules
import math

# Define variables
research_hours = 300
class_hours = 375

# As you are writing a script for the 1st time, make sure that you throwing in print
# statements CONSTANTLY to make sure everything is working.
print(research_hours)
print(class_hours)

# Well which one was which? Can you remember? Lets get more specific.
print("research: ", research_hours)
print("class: ", class_hours)

# Now we need to figure out how many hours of each type we are registering for. 
# Because this is going to change each semester
# we don't want to set this as a variable like we did above, 
# But instead it being able to be changed each time
# Like we did with the circumference example
research_input = input("How many research hours are you taking? ")
class_input = input("How many class hours are you taking? ")

# Okay Lets do our equation:
tuition = (research_input * research_hours) + (class_input * class_hours)

# That didn't do anything... All we did was define tuition, but we didn't put it to use
# So lets have it give us the answer
print(tuition)

# HOLY COW WHAT HAPPENED???
# Ohhhh yeah, we did not convert our input into an integer did we???
research_int = int(research_input)
class_int = int(class_input)
print(tuition)

# Well that didn't change anything so now what?
# Oh yeah, we did need to redefine the terms used in the tuition equation
tuition = research_int * research_hours + class_int * class_hours
print(tuition)

# Better print statement:
print("Your tuition will be: ", tuition)

# Even better print statement:
print("If you take ", research_input, "hours of research and ", class_input, \
 "hours of classes, your tuition will be: $", tuition)
